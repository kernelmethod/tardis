# MITRE ATT&CK T1620 (Reflective Code Loading): https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620/

# The following auditd rules will report calls to the memfd_create syscall,
# which creates a file handle to a memory address. In general this is a rather
# unusual syscall to see on a production system and may be indicative of an
# attempt to execute malicious code from memory, but YMMV.

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S memfd_create -k T1620_Reflective_Code_Loading
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S memfd_create -k T1620_Reflective_Code_Loading

# I've commented out these rules by default, but if you find that they don't
# generate too much noise, you may wish to include them alongside the ones
# above.

# -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execveat -k T1620_Reflective_Code_Loading
# -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execveat -k T1620_Reflective_Code_Loading
